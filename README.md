# Neural Network From Scratch for Housing Prices Prediction 🏠

This repository implements a simple feedforward **Neural Network from scratch (NumPy only)** 
to predict house prices using the [Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset).

## Features
- Custom implementation of:
  - Activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, etc.)
  - Loss functions (MSE, MAE)
  - Forward & Backward pass
  - Gradient Descent (Batch, Mini-batch, Stochastic)
- Experiment comparison across activations and optimizers
- Metrics: MSE, MAE, R²
